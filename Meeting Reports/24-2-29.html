<tr><td colspan=2> Progress report since : 1st Meeting with Second Supervisor
<pre>
    Damn i got reality checked hard...


















</pre></td></tr>
<tr><td> Anticipated problems :
<pre>
<li>Very poor planning and incomplete testing plan for individual unit which what cause me so many problems
</li>
<li>Bad initial research for components, mostly due to the fact I didnt seek proper guidance from <br> related department like Computer Vision group etc... mostly my own effort and self ego and low esteem issue...
</li>
<li>Requirements goal (moscow) is too broad just as Tom said (but i forgot and gaslit him :sob:)
</li>
<li>Check DETAILED how to evalute camera mounting and synchronisation</li>
<li>HOW TO SYNC FRAME!!!</li>














</pre></td> <td>Possible solutions:
<pre>
<li>Be more thorough and detailed especially for important critical part like synchronising camera <br>and dont assume or take given facts at face value, especially from someone trying to sell u <br>something like manufacturers specs sheet... wtf is life man this sucks... also only relying on <br>gantt chart is useless if the task is too broad without further details like having a testing plan etc.</li>
<li>Email related proffesor for some guidance now, including Tom Blount for further advice and <br>guidance ... though im quite skeptical they will care/reply and if this will work out at all, <br>its already kinda late anyway but worth trying at least ig...</li>
<li>Make more specific and tehnical moscow requirements</li>
<li>Make basic but working 3d Mount NOW and TESTING PLAN, maybe some arucode controlled environment, <br>just like experiments back in the day, change one thing at a time etc.</li>
<li>Idea so far is to set the fps to fixed, uses some distinct object/marker etc and HAVE CONCRETE TESTED PLAN FOR IT!!</li>

note: for image lifelogging, if the sync is too bad, another idea is to take video and cheery picked frames from it for images instead










</pre></td></tr>
<tr><td> Goals for : Before 5 March meeting with Tom Blount
<pre>
<li>PRINT FIXED BASIC MOUNT FOR CAMERA</li>
<li>get BASIC ALGO WROKING FOR USB WEBCAM</li>
<li>HAVE TESTING PLAN FOR SYNC AND EVALUTATION</li>
<li>GET BASIC OBJECT DETECTION AND METADATA TAGGING WORKING!!!</li>
<li>MORE SPECIFIC MOSCOW Requirements</li>
















</pre></td>
<td> Measured by :
<pre>

<li>Have 3d printed mount for cameras</li>
<li>can run the usb webcam for stereo video lifelogging</li>
<li>testing and evaluation plan for sync document written DETAILED</li>
<li>basic accurate object detection and metadata tagging on hd 30fps video frames from youtube</li>
<li>REWRITE MOSCOW REQUIREMENT TO BE MROE SPECIFIC</li>
